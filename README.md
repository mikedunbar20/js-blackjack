# js-blackjack

# This is a basic blackjack game that I created as a part of the Scrimba Javascript Development course. 
# The basic functionality is: 
 * Start a new game
 * Add another card if the player is below 21 
 * End game if the player clicks 'start game', hits 21, or exceeds 21
 * Display the player stats
